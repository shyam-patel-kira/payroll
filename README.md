## Idea

# Simple UI that lets you register employees and manage salary streams to them**
    
    When registering an employee youâ€™ll want their wallet address and personal info like name/age/address/etc. The UI then allows you to select an employee from a list and start a stream to them. It will display on-going streams to employees and allow you to modify as needed.
